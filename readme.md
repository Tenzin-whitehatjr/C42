**Object oriented programming concepts**
*Class* - A blueprint of objects which contains the properties and functions of an object. Properties are mentioned inside the constructor
*Objects* - Object is an instance of class. Object can be any real world entity.
*abstraction* - Process of hiding data.
*Inheritance* - the process of deriving one class from another class.
**Data types**
*Array* - Array is a data type used to for storing multiple data types together in a single variable. Elements inside an Array is accessed useing the index of an Array. The Array is 0 index based.
*Undefined* - Form of datatype is not mentioned.
*null* - Data type that holds no value.
*boolean* - It holds True or False values.
**arthmetic operators**
*concatenation* - the proccess of joining two strings or a string and a number or a string and a variable. For concatenation + is used, An example being ("Tenzin" + "Kelsang").
*modulus operator* - The output of the modulus operator is the remainder of normal division.
**conditional programming**
*if condition* - A condition where if certain conditions are met then the written action will be preformed.
*if else condition* - the if condition but if the conditions are not met then the written actions in the else segment will be preformed instead.
*switch condition* - Alernative way of writing Multiple if else conditions.
**loops**
*forloop* - 
for(initialization expression;conditional expression; increment expression; decrement expression){
Action given
}
Example
for(var I = 2; I=I<10;I=I+2){
    console.log(I)
    
}
output= 2,4,6,8
*while loop*
while(condition){
action
}
example
var i = 0
while(i<5){
    console.log(i)
    i=i+1
}

**function**
*ellipse* - It is used for creating circular objects.
ellipse(x,y,radiusX,radiusY);
*rect* - rect function is used for creating rectangles.
rect(x,y,width,height)
*tint* - Used to change Object transparency
tint(255,[alpha])
*stroke* - Used for giving color to the boundry of an object.
*fill* - Used to Color in an Object
*mousePressedOver* - Used to evoke a body or a sprite when mouse is pressed.
*mouseDragged*
*mouseReleased*
*random* - Used to get random numbers in between a limit.
random(minimum limit, Maximum limit)
*bounce,bounceoff* -Bounce will make an object collide with an object and make the other object move while bounceoff will only make the object moving go the opposite direction.
*translate* - Makes the object rotate with respect to the origin of the canvas.
*rotate* - Rotates an object to its own axis.
*push and pop* Push stars the change and pop stops the change and reverts back to push.

Messanger that connects the client with the server.
